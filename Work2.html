    <h3>Animated poster</h3>
    <p>An animated poster is a digital graphic piece that incorporates elements of movement and animation to create a dynamic visual presentation. Unlike traditional posters, which are static, animated posters use animation technologies to add life and capture the viewer's attention more effectively.</p> 
  <h3>Briefing</h3>
  <p>The briefing was given to us in the second year, in the second semester and we had to choose a traditional game and The traditional game we chose was Battleship, which is a two-player board game in which the opposing player has to guess where the opponent's ships are and vice versa. The aim is to guess where the opponent's ships are, and the player who takes out all the opponent's ships first wins. The briefing was given to us in the digital prototyping subject.</p>
