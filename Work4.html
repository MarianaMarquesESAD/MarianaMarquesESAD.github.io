    <h3>Poster made with AI</h3>
    <p>A poster made with AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a poster created using artificial intelligence technologies to automate or assist in the graphic design process. These tools can help with the creation of visual elements, the choice of colors, the layout, and even the generation of textual content or images.

    <h3>Briefing</h3>


<p>This work belongs to a workshop we had with two former ESAD students, who talked about Artificial Intelligence and taught us a lot about the subject. This workshop was done because we were doing a briefing on AI. I chose one of my favorite bands and made several promps about the band. In the end, I edited it in Adobe Photoshop and the final result is below.</p>
