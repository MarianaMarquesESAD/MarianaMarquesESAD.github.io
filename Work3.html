    <h3>Animated poster with Adobe Aero</h3>
    <p>Adobe Aero is a design tool developed by Adobe that allows you to create augmented reality (AR) experiences without the need to know how to program. It is used to create interactive and immersive content that can be viewed via mobile devices or AR headsets.</p>

    <h3>Briefing</h3>
    <p>We were asked to write this briefing for the multimedia project subject. <br>
      According to the contextualization presented in class, the aim of this proposal is for the student to develop one or more animations + interaction for dissemination in an augmented reality environment. This experience should be articulated and triggered by a composition developed by the student, in A3 format. This composition will be based on the phrase “Too many tools, so little time”, and it is IMPERATIVE that typography is the most prominent element in the composition. You can use other graphic elements, but only to support the graphic communication of the phrase in question. The phrase I'm presenting to you is an offshoot of an original phrase from the early 2000s, a teaser for the 2004 edition of the OFFF Barcelona festival. The original phrase, “Too many Plug Ins so little time”, translates this feeling of permanent anguish within contemporary societies. It's like saying “first world problems!” Characteristic of those who always want to be up to date. An increasingly utopian condition these days. How can we sort through everything that exists without having to know/know everything that is available? Considering that the idea of “PLUG IN” is a dead word, TOOLS had to be substituted. The aim is for the student to express critical thinking, both individual and collective, that translates the current social and cultural framework of digital media. The student will have to work with two-dimensional elements (2DAssets), using the depth of the placement of planes, the relationship between virtual and real elements, etc. to offer the user an illusory sensation of three-dimensionality and spatial recognition. Learning objectives: Know and be able to use the User Experience Design methodology. To know and be able to use the Design Thinking methodology. To know and discuss the emerging state-of-the-art technologies that support multimedia design.</p>
