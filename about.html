      <p>Hi, I'm Mariana, a UX designer based in Caldas da Rainha with a passion for creating perfect and enjoyable user experiences. I'm 21 years old and originally from Mira de Aire. <br>I especially enjoy working on design operations and systems that help bring order to complexity.
        When I'm not designing, you can find me enjoying Parque D.Carlos or playing games like League of Legends. I like to read a lot but I have a bit of an attention deficit. My hobbies include photography, which is and always will be a passion of mine. I've been photographing since I was 14, a lifelong passion that I initially wanted to turn into a profession. Thanks for visiting my portfolio
